# AD300 introduction-to-Stream-API-in-Java

Objective
The objective of this assignment is to get familiar with Java Stream API and understand how to use it to perform various operations on collections.

Task 1: Setting up the Environment

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later).
Set up your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code etc.)

Task 2: Creating a Stream

Create a new Java project and a class named StreamExample.
In the StreamExample class, create a main method.
Initialize a list of integers from 1 to 10.

Task 3: Intermediate Operations

Use the Stream API to filter out even numbers and print them.
Use the Stream API to map the list of numbers to their squares and print the squared values.
Combine filtering and mapping: Filter out odd numbers and then map them to their cubes.

Task 4: Terminal Operations

Use the reduce method to sum all the numbers in the list.
Use the collect method to gather all even numbers into a new list.

Task 5: Advanced Stream Operations

Use the flatMap method to flatten a list of lists into a single list.

Use the groupingBy collector to group numbers by even and odd.

Task 6: Stream with Custom Objects

Create a Person class with fields name and age.

Create a list of Person objects.

Use the Stream API to filter out people older than 25 and print their names.

Use the Stream API to find the oldest person in the list.

To run Test, open Intellij and press run.
